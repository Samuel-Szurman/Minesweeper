# Minesweeper
The project is based on the Minesweeper - a popular game known from Windows operation system. In my game I used hexagonal tiles instead of squares. The goal is to find all the tiles without bomb. To check the tile you need to left click. If there is a bomb you will lose, otherwise there will be shown a number that tells you how many adjacent hexagons contain a bomb. You can mark tiles with a flag to remember where could be a bomb.

To run the game you only need 'main.exe' file located in 'dist' folder. The project is written in Python using pygame library.
